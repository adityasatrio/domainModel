# domainModel
example between anemic and rich domain model

* anemic domain model is anti - pattern
* anemic domain model is not object-oriented programming.
* anemic domain can not guarantee that they are in a legal state at any time 
* anemic models are like procedural programming

* rich domain model is really object-oriented programming.
* The purpose of a rich domain model or of object-oriented programming is to bring data and logic together
* Object oriented means that: an object manages itâ€™s state and gurantees that it is in a legal state at any time.
